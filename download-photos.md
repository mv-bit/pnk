# Download Photos Instructions

Since I cannot directly access Google Drive, please follow these steps to add photos to your media gallery:

## Steps to Add Photos:

1. **Access the Google Drive folder:**
   - Go to: https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1lWrHyzOMWaeseZOg_O3-FYtjZmRV3x8k
   - Select 10 photos you want to use

2. **Download the photos:**
   - Select the photos you want
   - Right-click and choose "Download"
   - Or use Ctrl+A to select all, then download

3. **Rename and place the photos:**
   - Rename the downloaded photos to:
     - `photo-1.jpg`
     - `photo-2.jpg`
     - `photo-3.jpg`
     - ... up to `photo-10.jpg`
   - Place them in the `images/gallery/` folder

## Photo Naming Convention:

```
images/gallery/
├── photo-1.jpg    (Exterior view)
├── photo-2.jpg    (Loading docks)
├── photo-3.jpg    (Interior warehouse)
├── photo-4.jpg    (Office areas)
├── photo-5.jpg    (Truck parking)
├── photo-6.jpg    (Aerial view)
├── photo-7.jpg    (Security systems)
├── photo-8.jpg    (Storage systems)
├── photo-9.jpg    (Construction progress)
└── photo-10.jpg   (Site location)
```

## Fallback:

If photos are not found, the gallery will show placeholder images with the photo numbers. The gallery is already set up with:

- ✅ 10 photo slots
- ✅ Responsive grid layout (2 cols mobile, 3 cols tablet, 4 cols desktop)
- ✅ Hover effects with expand icons
- ✅ Rounded corners for modern look
- ✅ Fallback placeholder images
- ✅ Proper alt text for accessibility

## Alternative Method:

If you have trouble with the Google Drive link, you can:
1. Use any 10 warehouse/logistics photos
2. Name them `photo-1.jpg` through `photo-10.jpg`
3. Place them in `images/gallery/`
4. The gallery will automatically display them

The gallery is now ready and will work with any photos you add to the folder!
